**TL;DR:** Video generation with DiTs is **painfully slow** -- [HunyuanVideo](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo) takes 16 minutes to generate just a 5-second video on an H100 with FlashAttention3. Our sliding tile attention (STA) slashes this to **5 minutes** with **zero quality loss, no extra training required**.
Specifically, STA accelerates attention alone by **2.8‚Äì17x** over FlashAttention-2 and **1.6‚Äì10x** over FlashAttention-3. 
With STA and other optimizations, our solution boosts end-to-end generation speed by **2.98√ó** compared to the FA3 full attention baseline, without quality loss or the need for training. Enabling finetuning unlocks even greater speedups!

[//]: # (The bottleneck? Attention. It accounts for 13 of the 16 minutes required for video generation. We observe that attention scores in video diffusion models are highly localized in 3D space, with different heads needing different window sizes. This makes sliding window attention &#40;SWA&#41; an attractive alternative to retain full attention's expressiveness while reducing computational cost. However, 3D SWA is GPU-unfriendly and fails to translate FLOP savings into real speedups. We introduce **Sliding Tile Attention &#40;STA&#41;**, the first higher-order local attention with *efficient hardware implementation*.  Unlike SWA, STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design. STA accelerates attention by **2.8‚Äì17√ó** over FlashAttention-2 &#40;FA2&#41; and **1.6‚Äì10√ó** over FlashAttention-3 &#40;FA3&#41;. We design a calibration stategy to determine the optimal window size for each attention head. With STA and other optimizations, our solution boosts end-to-end generation speed by **2.98√ó** compared to the FA3 full attention baseline, without quality loss or the need for training.)

## Attention in Video DiTs

{{< justify >}}

State-of-the-art Video DiTs rely on 3D full attention to capture spatial and temporal relationships, allowing each token to attend to every other token across spatial and temporal dimensions. However, modern video models generate an enormous number of tokens -- HunyuanVideo, for instance, produces 115K tokens for just a 5-second 720p clip. The challenge worsens with higher resolution or longer duration: for a video of shape $(L, L, L)$ (assuming equal temporal and spatial dimensions), even a small increase in L causes a cubic explosion in token count. Since attention scales quadratically, this rapidly makes it the main computational bottleneck. As shown in Figure 1(a), attention overwhelmingly dominates inference cost.

{{< /justify >}}

{{< image src="img/attn_latancy.png" alt="Attn Latency" width="70%" title="Figure 1: (a) Generating a 5s 720P clip in Hunyuan involves processing 115K tokens, making attention the dominant cost. (b) Attention latency comparison: existing methods fail to translate FLOP reduction into wall-clock speedup; STA is hardware-efficient and achieves proportional speedup with sparsity">}}

{{< justify >}}
We hypothesize that 3D full attention contains significant redundancy, which, if efficiently leveraged, could greatly accelerate inference. 
To test this, we visualize HunyuanVideo's attention scores in Figure 2 (left) and uncover a strong 3D locality pattern: queries tend to focus primarily on spatially and temporally nearby keys. 
To quantify this, we compute attention recall -- the fraction of total attention scores concentrated within a local window. As shown in Figure 2 (middle), despite being trained with full 3D attention, 
HunyuanVideo exhibits strong locality: a small local window (just 15.52% of the total space) captures 70% of the total attention. 

[//]: # (Interestingly, while different attention heads show varying degrees of locality, their bevarious are generally static across different prompts. In Figure 2 &#40;right&#41;, we evaluate 10 different prompts and compute the standard deviation of attention recall across prompts for each head. The results show consistently low variance, indicating that the locality pattern for each head remains stable.)

Mid: Attention scores within the local window accouts for mojority of the entire attention. Right: Despite the different recall across heads, the standard deviation across prompts remains low.">}}


{{< justify >}}
Our analysis points to a  seemingly obvious solution: replace full 3D attention with localized attention to speed up video generation. 
A natural approach is Sliding Window Attention (SWA), widely used in 1D sequences for NLP. However, we find that **SWA completely breaks in 2D and 3D**! Despite its promise, there is no efficient implementation for 3D video DiTs.

Worse yet, as shown in Figure 1 (right), existing SWA methods like [CLEAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16112) and [NATTEN](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN) reduce FLOPs but fail to deliver real speedups -- strangled by poor hardware utilization. 
Why? Because higher-order sliding window attention is fundamentally incompatible with modern [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) (FA) and brutally inefficient on GPUs. In the next section, we expose exactly why traditional SWA falls apart -- and how we break past its limits.
{{< /justify >}}


## Inefficiency of Sliding Window Attention
{{< justify >}}
To understand why SWA is incompatible with FlashAttention (FA), we first need to review FA's **block-by-block** computation pattern. 
Instead of processing tokens individually, FA splits the input sequence $(Q, K, V)$ into small blocks -- typically (128, 64) -- and processes them efficiently on the GPU. For simplicity, we assume square blocks in this discussion.
FA loads an entire block of $Q$, $K$, and $V$ into GPU SRAM, performs all necessary computations, and writes back only the output matrix $O$ to HBM -- avoiding storing intermediate values like attention masks or scores.
As illustrated in Figure 3, FA effectively tiles the attention map into smaller blocks, making each block the fundamental unit of computation.
Why does this matter? First, this avoids materializing large intermediate tensors hence saves a lot of memory. Second, GPUs are built for matrix multiplications. They don't handle scalar or even vector operations efficiently; they thrive on block-by-block computation, not token-by-token processing.
{{< /justify >}}

{{< image src="img/attn_map.png" alt="Attn Map" width="100%" title="Figure 3. The attention map of NATTEN, Tiled NATTEN, and STA. We plot with an image size 24√ó24 and a 12√ó12 local window. The tile size is set to 4√ó4. Note that we mainly use STA in 3D scenarios for video generation in this paper, but for better illustration, we present the 2D scenario in this plot.">}}

{{< justify >}}
Implementing 2D/3D SWA with FlashAttention comes down to one major challenge: defining its attention mask. Depending on how the mask is applied, we categorize attention blocks into three types:

* **Dense blocks**: with all attention scores retained (highly efficient ‚úÖ), 
* **Empty blocks**: ‚Äì mask out all values (can be skipped entirely ‚úÖ), 
* **Mixed blocks** ‚Äì retain some scores while masking others (a nightmare for efficiency ‚ùå).

While dense and empty blocks work well with FA, mixed blocks introduce significant computational overhead due to the following issues:

* **Wasted computation**: Since a block is the minimum compute unit, FA must compute the entire block before applying the mask, leading to unnecessary work.
* **GPU-unfriendly masking**: The intra-block mask depends on both the user-defined attention pattern and the block‚Äôs location within the attention map. Worse, it cannot be precomputed‚Äîdoing so would cause quadratic memory overhead. Even in [FlexAttention](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention/), a simple causal mask adds 15% overhead‚Äîin 3D SWA, masking overhead can exceed the cost of computing the block itself!
That is why higher-order SWA is inherently GPU-unfriendly -- it produce too many mixed blocks! 

To illustrate, we analyze NATTEN in Figure 3(a), a refined SWA variant that shifts window centers at image/video boundaries to ensure each query attends to a fixed number of keys. However, this leads to queries attending to distinct key groups, disrupting uniformity in the attention map and creating a flood of mixed blocks.
To mitigate this, Tiled NATTEN reorders inputs to increase the number of dense blocks (Figure 3(b)). Yet, a significant portion of blocks remain mixed, making SWA fundamentally inefficient for GPUs.

Understanding why SWA produces the zigzag attention map in Figure 3 may not be immediately intuitive. To illustrate this effect, we provide an animation below that visualizes 2D SWA on an image of size (10,10) with a window size of (5,5).

## Sliding Tile Attention

{{< justify >}}
The idea behind *Sliding Tile Attention (STA)* is simple: GPUs work best with *block-by-block* computations, but SWA slides its window *token-by-token*, which is inefficient. Our proposed STA fixes this by sliding *tile-by-tile*. In 3D scenarios, we define a tile as a contiguous group of tokens forming a spatial-temporal cube, with its size determined
by the block size in FlashAttention. This small change eliminates *mixed blocks* in the attention map and significantly improves computational efficiency.

- **SWA**: Moves *token-by-token*, creating irregular attention maps that GPUs struggle with.
- **STA**: Moves *tile-by-tile*, forming dense and empty attention blocks that are GPU-friendly.

Specifically, 
1. A video of size $(L, L, L)$ is divided into non-overlapping tiles of size $(T, T, T)$. Assuming Flash Attention's block size is $(B, B)$, T should satisfy the condition  $B = T^3$.
2. Tokens within each tile are **flattend consecutively**. The window size should also be integer multiple of the tile size.
3. The attention window **moves tile-by-tile** with a step size of $(T, T, T)$. For each local window, the central query tiles attend to keys within the window. 
4. This results in only dense and empty blocks in the attention map, completely eliminating inefficient mixed blocks, as shown in Figure 3 (c).
{{< /justify >}}

The video below demonstrates how STA works. For better illustration, we use a 2D scenario. In this example, we apply STA to a 10√ó10 image with (2,2) tiles and a (6,6) window.
{{<youtube D4gZ--LhZHs>}}

{{< justify >}}
 STA can be efficiently implemented with FlexAttention, which provides enough functionality to skip all empty blocks and avoid adding unnecessary *intra-block* mask on the dense blocks. We can further optimize the sparse attention masks by *disaggregating* the *inter-block* mask logic from the compute kernels. Thus, we implement our attention kernels based on ThunderKittens and FlashAttention3 . 
 
## Kernel-level Optimizations for STA

Inpired by FlashAttention 3 and [ThunderKittens](https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens), our implementation split the threadblock into compute warpgroups and data warpgroups, and the inter-block mask is completely managed by the data warpgroups. Each compute warpgroup is responsible for calculating one query block, which always resides in the SRAM (Split-Q). The data warpgroup is responsible for asynchronously loading the KV blocks from HBM to SRAM. For each block of query, the data warpgroup needs to decide which key and value blocks the query block will attend to in STA and only load those blocks. Since the data warpgroups are asynchronous, the overhead of calculating the inter-block mask in STA and deciding which data to load can be hidden with overlapping. On the other hand, the compute worker is completely oblivious of the sparse attention pattern. It performs attention computation with the key value blocks in shared memory loaded by data workers, and once all data is consumed in the circular cache, the computation is finished.

### Kernel Performance
We report our kernel performance in Table 1. The results show that existing local attention methods struggle with efficiency. For example, while CLEAR reduces FLOPs to 15.65, it actually slows down inference by 14%. NATTEN also falls short‚Äîdespite achieving 91% sparsity, its basic version is 15% slower than full attention, and even the optimized tiled variant in FlexAttention only speeds things up by 1.27√ó. Among current options, [Swin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030) is the only kernel with a memory utilization factor (MFU) above 40% and kernel efficiency above 60%, but it sacrifices flexibility in the attention mechanism -- Swin is not a local attention variant, and we will show in the next section that applying swin the video generation models significantly degrades performance. 

In contrast, when tested in FlexAttention, **STA improves MFU from 8.20% to 41.03% compared to Tiled NATTEN**. 
With further kernel optimizations, STA achieves a **10.45√ó** speedup over full attention. Even at 58.33% sparsity, it still delivers 2.37√ó faster processing. 
This means STA can handle larger attention windows while still outperforming NATTEN. To our knowledge, **STA is the first method to combine efficient 3D sparse local attention with real-world speed improvements**.

## Window Size Calibration Enables Training-free Speedup

As shown ealier in Figure 2 (right), video diffusion models exhibit strong 3D locality and head specialization. While different attention heads capture information at different scales, their locality patterns remain consistent across prompts. This allows us to search for an optimal window size per head using a small set of prompts and generalize the results to others. Specifically, for each $(s, l, h)$ tuple‚Äîwhere $s$ is the inference step index, $l$ is the layer index, and $h$ is the head index‚Äîwe determine the best attention mask.

Since early sampling steps are crucial for global structure, we retain full attention for the first 15 steps. For the remaining steps, we pick candidate masks from a predefined set by computing the L2 distance between their outputs and full attention outputs, selecting the mask with the lowest distance. Our video generation setup uses a $117√ó768√ó1280$ resolution, translating to a DiT shape of $30√ó48√ó80$. We set the tile size to $6√ó8√ó8$ and select from window sizes [$(30, 24, 24)$, $(18, 24, 40)$, $(6, 48, 80)$, $(30, 48, 8)$, $(30, 8, 80)$]. We calibrate on 18 prompts, averaging the L2 distance across them to determine the best mask strategy per head. The entire search process completes in under 18 hours on a single H100 GPU. STA with window size calibration achieves an attention sparsity of 58% and a **1.8x** end-to-end speedup, reducing DiT inference time from 945 seconds (FA3 full attn) to **520** seconds with no quality degradation.

STA accelerates attention by exploiting redundancy in 3D full attention. Another approach to speeding up video generation focuses on caching, leveraging redundancy across diffusion steps. We demonstrate that STA is **compatible** to [TeaCache](https://github.com/ali-vilab/TeaCache), a state-of-the-art diffusion acceleration technique based on caching. Together, our solution brings **3x** speedup, reducing DiT inference time from 945 seconds to **317** seconds with no quality loss. 


We evaluate our method on 200 randomly selected prompts from the MovieGen Bench. Below, we provide additional **uncherry-picked** qualitative comparisons between the original Hunyuan model and our 3√ó speedup solution.

## Training with STA Unlocks Greater Speedup

Beyond searching for the optimal sparse mask per attention head, we can use a fixed window and fine-tune STA to maximize performance while maintaining high sparsity. Since STA follows the *3D locality* property, this adaptation can be learned efficiently with minimal training overhead. In our experiments, fine-tuning took just 8 hours on 8 H100 GPUs‚Äînegligible compared to the cost of pretraining video diffusion models. Although each attention layer operates on a restricted local window, the receptive field expands through stacked transformer layers, allowing the Diffusion Transformer to generate globally coherent videos.

STA achieves both high-quality video generation and significant speedup, while CLEAR and Tiled NATTEN suffer from efficiency issues and Swin suffers from quality degradation.">}})

[//]: # ([//]: # &#40;This fine-tuning step allows STA to efficiently recover video quality while unlocking greater speedup. We use [VBench]&#40;https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench&#41; for a quantatatie evaluation of STA. We first examine the impact of directly replacing full attention with sparse attention, without tuning, to evaluate how well each algorithm approximates full 3D attention. In Table 2, CLEAR and Tiled NATTEN retain reasonable video quality &#40;VBench scores of 82.37% and 82.68%, respectively&#41; compared to full attention &#40;82.71%&#41;. However, despite sparsifying attention, these methods paradoxically increase end-to-end inference latency. [Swin]&#40;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030&#41; presents the opposite challenge: while it achieves moderate speedup &#40;1.24√ó‚Äì1.90√ó&#41;, its rigid, nonoverlapping window partitions prevent local queries and keys from attending to each other if they fall into separate windows, violating the 3D locality property. This results in degraded video quality, and crucially, fine-tuning with Swin attention not only fails to recover performance but further lowers the VBench score. In contrast, STA addresses both&#41; quality and efficiency limitations. )
For example, with a very sparse window configuration of wt=(18,24,24), it achieves 91.00% attention sparsity, yielding a 5.76√ó FLOPs reduction and a 3.53√ó actual latency reduction.
Importantly, this efficiency gain comes with minimal quality tradeoff: STA maintains an 80.58% [VBench score](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench) in the training-free setting and improves to 82.62% with fine-tuning.


## Final Thoughts
{{< justify >}}

[//]: # (It might seem surprising that there was no efficient 2D/3D sliding window attention before STA. After all, sliding window attention is a fundamental algorithm‚Äîwidely used in 1D contexts. Why hasn‚Äôt an efficient 2D/3D implementation existed until now?)

[//]: # (To make you believe this claim, consider the Swin Transformer. The authors recognized that sliding window attention lacked an efficient 2D implementation. Their solution? Simply avoid it. Instead of true sliding windows, Swin uses non-overlapping and static window partitions. However, this prevents queries and keys from attending across window boundaries, breaking the 3D locality crucial for video tasks. Since Swin is used in a pretraining setup, this limitation is addressed by using different window partitions across different layers and force the model to learn such pattern. However, in training-free or fine-tuning scenarios like ours, Swin performs suboptimally. Their proposed solution win won the Marr Prize at ICCV 2021. )


It might seem surprising that efficient 2D/3D sliding window attention did not exist before STA -- after all, it‚Äôs a fundamental concept and widely used in 1D contexts. So why has no one cracked the kernels for 2D/3D until now?

Retrospectively, let‚Äôs take a look at the Swin Transformer. The authors faced the same challenge: efficient 2D sliding window attention kernels were nontrivial to implement. 
Their solution? Avoid it altogether. Instead of true sliding windows, Swin uses non-overlapping, static window partitions, sidestepping the efficiency issue but at the cost of breaking cross-window attention, which is crucial for video tasks.
Of course, Swin gets away with this because it's used in a pretraining setup -- the model compensates for the limitation by learning to stitch information across layers with shifting windows. 
That‚Äôs fine when you have the luxury of pretraining, but in training-free or fine-tuning scenarios like ours, it just doesn't work as well.

So, if nothing else, we take comfort in knowing that solving this problem was never supposed to be easy‚Äîbut that just makes the progress even more exciting!

## Conclusion 

*We believe STA‚Äôs potential extends far beyond accelerating video diffusion models.* It can be applied in pretraining and generalized to other high-order data. 
Locality is a universal property across almost all data modalities. We hope STA inspires new, more efficient models across various domains.
